-Facebook (Kinda...)-
This is an application in which you can create a user and upload posts
on your profile page! Share your feelings with your friends.
Soon enough you will be able to create a following list and see the posts of all the 
people you follow on your feed. You will be able to leave comments and get comments
on your own posts as well!

-To do-

User profile related stuff:
- Need to add the options to delete / update user posts
- Add each user's path to their profiles (something like "watch my profile as others see me")
- Add support to upload user picture/header

General:
- Adding search bar to search for users and add them to following list (and to friends list afterwards)
- Finishing User's feed: in the feed the user will see his friends latest posts
- PostComments logic and UI
